My current task/project is to build a basic recipe website using the skills and knowledge I have gained so far. 

I have succesfully managed to create a basic recipe website following the steps/assignment during The Odin Project Foundation course.

I believe that I have managed to incorporate all of the skills that I have learned so far which includes but is not limited to: Creating a HTML boilerplate, using appropriate headers, ordered/unordered lists, absolute/relative links, using images, the use of Git/GitHub/Linux terminal in general.

I must commit more often using Git and further develop my understanding of a Git workflow.
